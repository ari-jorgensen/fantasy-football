# fantasy-football

## Project Overview
Data analytics and professional sports are known to compliment each other well. I wanted to take this a step further and use visualizations to assist in the 
analysis of the performance of my fantasy football team. This project and the visualizations that it contains were designed to both provide the user with 
useful statistic so as to to properly asses the quality of the team, as well as engage the reader so that they are interested in exploring the data that is being 
presented.
