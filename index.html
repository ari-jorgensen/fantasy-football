    <p class="main-overview">I have been playing fantasy football since 2017. Despite my best efforts, I have yet to achieve the highest honor: winning first place in the league. I have decided that 2021/2022 will be my year for victory. To help achieve this goal, I will use this project to analyze my team and predict the likelihood of finally finishing in first place. Join me in my quest to be the best.</p>
